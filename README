This is a sample project on how the LMAX Disruptor (.NET Ported Version 1.0) can be using with WCF.

The Project is created in .NET Framework 4.0 and needs Microsoft VS2010.

The Solution has 4 projects. The Disruptor, a Producer (WCF Client Console App) and a Consumner (WCF Service Console App) and a shared project with utility and shared classes. 

The Consumer should be started before the Producer.
